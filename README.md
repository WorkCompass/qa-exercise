At WorkCompass, we are always looking for quality. We want to provide the best experience to our customers and users. We value continuous improvement.

We would like that you create a document, ideally, 1 page (maximum 2), explaining your approach for testing the given page, but nothing too complex.

## Requirements

2. At least 1 or more Test cases
3. At least 1 or more Acceptance criteria
